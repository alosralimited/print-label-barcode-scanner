   - ✅ 404.html for SPA routing

2. **PowerShell Deploy Script** (`deploy-github-pages.ps1`)
   - ✅ Manual deployment option
   - ✅ Automatic build with correct settings
   - ✅ Git branch management

3. **Build Output** (`build/web/`)
   - ✅ Built with base-href: `/print-label-barcode-scanner/`
   - ✅ .nojekyll file present

## 🎯 Next Steps to Deploy:

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   # Go to your repository on GitHub:
   # https://github.com/alosralimited/print-label-barcode-scanner
   
   # Navigate to: Settings → Pages
   # Under "Source", select: GitHub Actions
   ```

2. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/alosralimited/print-label-barcode-scanner/actions`
   - Watch the workflow execute (~2-3 minutes)
   - Your app will be live at: `https://alosralimited.github.io/print-label-barcode-scanner/`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

Run the PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\deploy-github-pages.ps1
```

## 📱 Testing on iPad/iPhone:

Once deployed, follow these steps:

### 1. Open on Device
- Open Safari on your iPad/iPhone
- Navigate to: `https://alosralimited.github.io/print-label-barcode-scanner/`

### 2. Install as Web App
- Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow)
- Tap **Add to Home Screen**
- Give it a name (e.g., "Label Scanner")
- Tap **Add**

### 3. Use Like Native App
- The app icon will appear on your home screen
- Tap to open - works like a native app!
- Camera access for barcode scanning (will request permission)
- Full offline support with service workers

## 🔧 Features Optimized for Mobile:

- ✅ **Touch-optimized UI** - Flutter automatically handles touch
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Adapts to iPad/iPhone screens
- ✅ **PWA support** - Install to home screen
- ✅ **Camera access** - For barcode scanning (HTTPS enabled)
- ✅ **Offline capable** - Service worker caching
- ✅ **Fast loading** - Optimized assets (99% icon reduction)

## 📊 Build Statistics:

```
Font asset "CupertinoIcons.ttf": 257KB → 2KB (99.2% reduction)
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf": 1.6MB → 8KB (99.5% reduction)
Build time: ~27 seconds
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

### Camera not working on iPad
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this automatically)
- Check Safari permissions: Settings → Safari → Camera
- Allow camera access when prompted

### App not loading
- Wait 2-3 minutes after push for deployment to complete
- Check Actions tab for any errors
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Changes not appearing
- GitHub Pages deployment takes 2-3 minutes
- Try hard refresh: Safari → Hold reload button → "Reload Without Content Blockers"

## 🔄 Update Process:

1. Make code changes
2. Commit and push to `main` branch
3. GitHub Actions automatically rebuilds and deploys
4. Changes live in ~2-3 minutes
5. Refresh app on iPad/iPhone
