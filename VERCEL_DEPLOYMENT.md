# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## üöÄ Deploy Your Barcode Scanner to Vercel (Step-by-Step)

**Note:** Vercel has removed drag-and-drop upload. Deployment is now done via Git (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

---

## PART 1: Push Your Code to GitHub ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Commit Your Latest Changes

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Update deployment files and Flutter plugins"
git push origin main
```

#### What this does:

- `git add .` - Stages all changed files (including build/web folder)
- `git commit` - Saves changes locally with a message
- `git push` - Uploads changes to GitHub

**Wait 10 seconds** for GitHub to receive your files.

---

## PART 2: Deploy to Vercel üöÄ

### Step 2: Go to Vercel Import Page

Open this link: **<https://vercel.com/new>**

#### What you'll see:

- A page titled "Import Git Repository" or "Let's build something new"
- Options to connect with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

### Step 3: Connect Your GitHub Account

1. Click **"Continue with GitHub"** (or "Add GitHub Account" if you see it)
2. A popup will ask you to authorize Vercel
3. Click **"Authorize Vercel"**
4. If asked, enter your GitHub password

#### What this does:

- Gives Vercel permission to read your GitHub repositories
- You only need to do this once

### Step 4: Import Your Repository

1. After authorization, you'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
2. Find **"alosralimited/print-label-barcode-scanner"**
3. Click **"Import"** next to it

#### If you don't see your repository:

- Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions"
- Select "All repositories" or just your repository
- Click "Install"

### Step 5: Configure Build Settings

You'll see a configuration page with these fields:

#### Project Name:

- Leave as default or change it (e.g., "barcode-scanner")

#### Framework Preset:

- Click the dropdown
- Select **"Other"** (Flutter is not in the list, so choose "Other")

#### Root Directory:

- Leave as **"./"** (default)

#### Build Command:

- Leave this EMPTY (recommended)
- Why: Vercel runners don't have Flutter by default. Leaving it empty tells Vercel to serve the files you already built and committed.
- Only if you really want Vercel to build, set: `flutter build web --release` (requires a custom setup). Exit code 127 or a message like `lutter build web --release` indicates a missing/typo build command.

#### Output Directory:

- Enter: `build/web`
- **What this does:** Tells Vercel where to find your built files
- **IMPORTANT:** This is the key setting! Make sure it says `build/web`

#### Install Command:

- Leave this EMPTY

### Step 6: Deploy

1. Click the big blue **"Deploy"** button
2. Vercel will start building your app
3. You'll see a progress screen with logs

#### What's happening:

- Vercel downloads your code from GitHub
- Since Build Command is empty, it skips building and serves `build/web` as static files
- It uploads the `build/web` folder to Vercel's CDN

#### This takes 2-5 minutes.

### Step 7: Get Your Live URL

When deployment finishes, you'll see:

#### üéâ Congratulations! Your project has been deployed!

You'll see:

- A preview image of your site
- A URL like: `https://print-label-barcode-scanner.vercel.app`
- Or: `https://your-project-name-xxxxx.vercel.app`

**Click the URL** to open your live barcode scanner!

### Step 8: Test Your App

1. Open the URL on your iPhone or computer
2. Click "Scan Barcode"
3. Allow camera permissions
4. Point camera at a barcode
5. The scanner should work!

## üìã TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Build failed" or Exit code 127 on Vercel

This happens when Vercel tries to run a build command but Flutter isn't installed or the command is mistyped (e.g., `lutter build web --release`).

#### Fix (no server build):

1. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Build & Development Settings
2. Set:
    - Build Command: EMPTY
    - Install Command: EMPTY
    - Output Directory: `build/web`
3. Save ‚Üí Redeploy

Optional: Add `vercel.json` (already added) so Vercel serves from `build/web` automatically:

```json
{
   "version": 2,
   "builds": [
      { "src": "build/web/**", "use": "@vercel/static" }
   ],
   "routes": [
      { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/build/web/$1" }
   ]
}
```

### Problem: Blank page or "404 Not Found"

#### Check:

1. Output Directory is set to `build/web` (not just `build`)
2. Your `build/web/index.html` exists in GitHub
3. Redeploy after changing settings

### Problem: Camera doesn't work

#### On iPhone:

- iOS requires HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically ‚úÖ)
- Make sure you clicked "Allow" when prompted for camera access
- Try Safari browser (works best on iOS)

#### On Computer:

- Some browsers block camera on localhost
- Vercel's HTTPS URL should work fine

---

## ‚úÖ BENEFITS OF VERCEL

- ‚úÖ No base href issues (unlike GitHub Pages!)
- ‚úÖ Automatic HTTPS (required for camera on iPhone)
- ‚úÖ Fast global CDN
- ‚úÖ Free SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys when you push to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Easy to set up custom domains

---

## üîÑ UPDATING YOUR APP LATER

When you make changes to your Flutter app:

1. **Build the updated app:**

   ```powershell
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update app"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Vercel automatically redeploys!**
   - No need to do anything else
   - Wait 2 minutes, your site is updated

#### OR manually trigger a redeploy:

- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click your project
- Click "Redeploy"

---

## üìû NEED HELP?

If deployment still doesn't work:

1. Share the Vercel deployment logs (copy/paste the error)
2. Share your live URL
3. Describe what you see (blank page, error message, etc.)

---

**Good luck! üöÄ**

- ‚úÖ Automatic HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Simpler setup

---

## üì± After Deployment

1. Open URL on iPhone
2. Grant camera permissions
3. Test barcode scanner
4. Should work perfectly!

---

## üîß Alternative: Vercel CLI

If you want to use command line:

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI (requires Node.js)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd build/web
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts - Done!
```

---

## üåê Your Deployment URLs

- Vercel (new): `https://print-label-barcode-scanner.vercel.app`
- GitHub Pages (has issues): `https://alosralimited.github.io/print-label-barcode-scanner/`

Use Vercel for production! üéâ
