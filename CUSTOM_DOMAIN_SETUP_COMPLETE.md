# ‚úÖ Custom Domain Setup Complete

## Implementation Summary

The GitHub Pages deployment has been successfully configured to support the custom subdomain **scanner.alosralimited.com**.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Fixed
**File: `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`**

The workflow has been updated to:
- ‚úÖ Remove duplicate deployment step
- ‚úÖ Add proper CNAME file copy from `web/CNAME` to build output
- ‚úÖ Ensure correct build order and artifact preparation

**Key Changes:**
```yaml
- name: Copy CNAME file for custom domain
  run: cp web/CNAME build/web/CNAME
```

This ensures that the CNAME file containing `scanner.alosralimited.com` is included in every deployment.

#### 2. Documentation Updated
**File: `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md`**

Updated to reflect subdomain configuration:
- ‚úÖ Changed all references from apex domain to subdomain
- ‚úÖ Simplified DNS configuration (CNAME only for subdomain)
- ‚úÖ Added SSL certificate provisioning information
- ‚úÖ Updated all URLs to use scanner.alosralimited.com

### What's Already Done

1. ‚úÖ **CNAME File Exists**: `web/CNAME` contains `scanner.alosralimited.com`
2. ‚úÖ **Workflow Updated**: GitHub Actions will copy CNAME file on every deployment
3. ‚úÖ **Base HREF Correct**: Set to `/` (correct for custom domain)
4. ‚úÖ **Documentation Updated**: Complete instructions for DNS and GitHub configuration

## üéØ Next Steps (Required User Actions)

To complete the custom domain setup, you need to:

### Step 1: Configure DNS in Squarespace

1. Log into your Squarespace account
2. Navigate to: [DNS Settings for alosralimited.com](https://account.squarespace.com/domains/managed/alosralimited.com/dns/dns-settings)
3. Add this CNAME record:

   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Host: scanner
   Points to: alosralimited.github.io
   ```

4. Save the changes
5. **Wait 1-48 hours** for DNS propagation

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
3. Under **Custom domain**, enter: `scanner.alosralimited.com`
4. Click **Save**
5. Wait for DNS verification (GitHub will check the CNAME record)
6. Once verified (green checkmark), enable **Enforce HTTPS**

### Step 3: Wait for SSL Certificate

- After DNS is verified, GitHub will automatically request an SSL certificate
- This can take **up to 1 hour**
- Once issued, HTTPS will be automatically enabled
- The site will be accessible at: `https://scanner.alosralimited.com/`

## üìä Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the setup:

- [ ] DNS CNAME record added in Squarespace
- [ ] DNS propagation complete (check at [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org))
- [ ] Custom domain configured in GitHub Pages settings
- [ ] DNS verification passed (green checkmark in GitHub)
- [ ] SSL certificate issued (HTTPS enabled)
- [ ] Site accessible at `https://scanner.alosralimited.com/`

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### DNS Not Propagating
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
- Check status at: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter: `scanner.alosralimited.com`
- Should show CNAME pointing to: `alosralimited.github.io`

### GitHub DNS Check Failing
- Ensure the CNAME record is correct: `scanner` ‚Üí `alosralimited.github.io`
- Wait for DNS to propagate (can take 1-48 hours)
- Try removing and re-adding the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

### Certificate Not Issued
- Ensure DNS is fully propagated first
- Certificate provisioning can take up to 1 hour after DNS is verified
- Check the GitHub Pages settings page for certificate status

### Site Not Loading
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try in incognito/private mode
3. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully (Actions tab)
4. Check that CNAME file is in the deployed artifacts

---

## üì± Testing the Site

Once setup is complete:

1. Open Safari on iPad/iPhone
2. Navigate to: `https://scanner.alosralimited.com/`
3. Verify the barcode scanner loads correctly
4. Test camera permissions (should prompt on first use)
5. Add to Home Screen for PWA experience

---

## üîÑ Deployment Process

**Automatic Deployment:**
- Every push to the `main` branch triggers deployment
- GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
- CNAME file is included in every deployment
- Changes appear live in ~2-3 minutes

**No manual intervention needed** - the workflow handles everything!

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions workflow logs (Actions tab)
2. Verify DNS settings in Squarespace
3. Review the troubleshooting section above
4. Check GitHub Pages settings page for error messages

---

## üéâ Success!

Once all steps are complete, your Flutter barcode scanner app will be live at:

**https://scanner.alosralimited.com/**

The app will be:
- ‚úÖ Secured with HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Accessible on all devices
- ‚úÖ Installable as a PWA on mobile devices
- ‚úÖ Automatically updated with every code push
