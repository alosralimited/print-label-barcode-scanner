## Complete Step-by-Step Guide

---

## üéØ OPTION 1: Use the Web App (Easiest - Works Right Now!)

### Step 1: Make Sure Vercel is Deployed

Before using on iPhone, you need to deploy to Vercel once:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: <https://vercel.com/dashboard>
2. **Click your project**: `print-label-barcode-scanner`
3. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí Build & Development Settings
4. **Set these values**:
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Install Command: [leave **empty**]
   - Build Command: [leave **empty**]
   - Output Directory: **`build/web`**
5. **Click Save**
6. **Go to Deployments** ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí **Redeploy**
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Get Your Live URL

After deployment finishes:

- You'll see a URL like: `https://print-label-barcode-scanner.vercel.app`
- Or: `https://print-label-barcode-scanner-xxxxx.vercel.app`
- **Copy this URL** (you'll need it for your iPhone)

---

### Step 3: Open on Your iPhone

1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone (Safari works best for camera access)
2. **Type or paste your Vercel URL** in the address bar
3. **Press Go**

You should see:

- A page with "Flutter Demo Home Page"
- A counter (You have pushed the button this many times: 0)
- A button labeled **"Scan Barcode"** with a QR code icon

---

### Step 4: Allow Camera Access

1. **Tap the "Scan Barcode" button**
2. Safari will ask: **"[Your app] Would Like to Access the Camera"**
3. **Tap "Allow"**

**Important Notes:**

- This permission request only appears the first time
- If you accidentally tapped "Don't Allow", you can fix it:
  - Go to iPhone Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera
  - Or go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Enable

---

### Step 5: Scan a Barcode

1. After allowing camera, you'll see:
   - **Live camera preview** on your screen
   - A "Scan Barcode" title at the top
   - A back arrow (‚Üê) to go back

2. **Point your iPhone camera at any barcode**:
   - Product barcodes (UPC/EAN)
   - QR codes
   - ISBN barcodes on books
   - Any 1D or 2D barcode

3. **The app will automatically scan**:
   - No need to tap a button
   - Keep the barcode centered and in focus
   - The scanner will beep or vibrate (if enabled)

4. **After scanning**:
   - The camera closes automatically
   - You return to the home page
   - A message appears at the bottom: **"Scanned: [barcode value]"**
   - Example: "Scanned: 1234567890123"

---

### Step 6: Scan More Barcodes

- **Tap "Scan Barcode"** again to scan another one
- No need to allow camera again (permission is saved)
- Repeat as many times as needed

---

## üìå Add to iPhone Home Screen (Optional - Works Like a Real App!)
