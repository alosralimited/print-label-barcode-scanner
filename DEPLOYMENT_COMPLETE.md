## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### Base HREF
The app is configured to deploy at: `/print-label-barcode-scanner/`

This is set in:
- GitHub Actions workflow: `--base-href="/print-label-barcode-scanner/"`
- PowerShell script: `--base-href="/$repoName/"`

### .nojekyll File
Both deployment methods include a `.nojekyll` file to ensure Flutter web apps work correctly on GitHub Pages.

### Permissions
The GitHub Actions workflow has proper permissions set:
- `contents: read` - To read repository content
- `pages: write` - To deploy to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - For secure deployment

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?
- Ensure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" source
- Check that the workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/`
- Verify you're pushing to the `main` branch

### Deployment Failing?
- Check the Actions tab for error details
- Ensure the repository is public
- Verify Flutter dependencies are correct in `pubspec.yaml`

### Site Not Loading?
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the base-href is correct

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Use GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment
2. **Test locally** before deploying: `flutter run -d chrome`
3. **Monitor deployments** in the Actions tab
4. **Test on real devices** after deployment
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: `flutter pub upgrade`
